# THIS FILE IS TO BE ADDED BECAUSE OF GIT NOT RECOGNIZING
# EMPTY FOLDERS. STILL IF YOU WANT TO COMPILE MY PROGRAM
# YOU'D BETTER HAVE A junk FOLDER IN WHICH ALL OBJECTS
# ARE STORED, makes all that "make clean" magic ;]

# you can execute the program without compiling, see README
# at the root path
